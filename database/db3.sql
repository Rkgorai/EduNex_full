Given this, it is still important to learn C and C++ because of the efficiency they offer. While we appreciate that Java is good for applications, for graphics; and we acknowledge that Python is appropriate for portable software, engineering problem solving (especially ML), and graphics; it is worth bearing in mind that the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and PVM (Python Virtual Machine - Python interpreter) are indeed written in C++, making C++ the father of all languages today.\n \n Well, C++ is the systems language. It is multi-paradigm - procedural, object-oriented, functional, and generic. So, why should I learn it if my primary focus is on applications? The answer lies in the recent updates of C++, namely, C++11, C++14, C++17, and upcoming C++20 that offer excellent depths and flexibility for C++ that no language can match. These extensions attempt to alleviate many of the long-standing shortcomings of C++ including porous resource management, error-prone pointer handling, expression semantics, and better readability.\n \n The present course builds up on the knowledge of C programming and basic data structure (array, list, stack, queue, binary tree etc.) to create a strong familiarity with C++98 and C++03.

Such analysis requires the engineer and researcher to deal with such functions that have an inherent ability to localize as much as possible in the two domains simultaneously.This poses a fundamental challenge because such a simultaneous localization is ultimately restricted by the uncertainty principle for signal processing.

There are many practical situations in which one needs to analyze the signal simultaneously in both the time and frequency domains, for example, in audio processing, image enhancement, analysis and processing, geophysics and in biomedical engineering. Such analysis requires the engineer and researcher to deal with such functions, that have an inherent ability to localize as much as possible in the two domains simultaneously.This poses a fundamental challenge because such a simultaneous localization is ultimately restricted by the uncertainty principle for signal processing.

It starts with basic circuit components and circuit concepts and then, gradually moves to practical building blocks of analog electronic systems. In this course, a serious attempt has been made to make a balance between theory and practice so that the discussed circuits can be constructed in an undergraduate level laboratory class and their measured performance can be easily compared with the analytically predicted performance. It helps to build confidence on theory. \n The other important feature of this course is, it covers both BJT based circuits and MOSFET based circuits parallel so that similarities and performance differences between these two classes of circuits are understandable.

Urbanization is not a new phenomenon; the ancient cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, Ancient Greece, Rome and Mesopotamia are strong evidences. However, with our entry to the era of the Anthropocene, rapid urbanization with its rate, scale and shifting geographies (with intense urbanization in the global south: Asia, Africa and Latin America) is upsetting the ecological balance complemented with rising inequity, displacement and loss of livelihoods affecting the urban poor.\n \n What is the solution? Should urbanization be perceived as the key challenge and strategies must be devised to halt it, if not reverse it (as it is irreversible) Can there be other innovative alternatives that do not perceive cities as consumptive spaces swallowing ecological resources and generating highest ecological footprints, but also as contributors to ecological sustainability\n \n While policy prescriptions laid out in the UN Sustainable Urbanization framework or Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer technocratic directions and guidelines, it is extremely important to empirically investigate the relationship cities and their wider environments to not only identify challenges but also map potentials and learn lessons towards the development of a robust resilient urban environmental matrix that will not only be technically sound and feasible but also informed by socio-economic and political realities and determinants. With lessons from emerging urban social sciences frameworks such as urban environmental history and urban political ecology and with the empirical focus on South Asia, the course will shed light on cities as complex socio-natural-technical assemblages, encompassing elaborate technical apparatus and intricate social arrangements evolved along shifting temporal scales and development imperatives.

As the latest TIOBE Index for April 2016 indicates – Java (21%), C (14%), C++ (6%), C#(4%), and Python (3%) together control nearly half the programming community. Given this, it is still important to learn C and C++ because of the efficiency they offer. While we appreciate that Java is good for applications, for graphics; and we acknowledge that Python is appropriate for portable software, engineering problem solving, and graphics; it is worth bearing in mind that the JVM and Python interpreter are indeed written in C++, making C++ the father of all languages today.Well, hence, C++ is the systems language. Why should I learn it if my primary focus is on applications? This is where the recent updates of C++, namely, C++11, C++14, and C++17 offer excellent depths and flexibility for C++ that no language can match. These extensions attempt to alleviate some of the long-standing shortcomings for C++ including porous resource management, error-prone pointer handling, expression semantics and better readability.The present course builds up on the knowledge of C programming and basic data structure (array, list, stack, queue etc.) to create a strong familiarity with C++98 and C++03.

The task of a user then is only to pose a problem as a CSP, and then call an off-the-shelf solver. CSPs are amenable to combining search based methods with reasoning. In this 2 credit course we will look at general approaches to solving finite domain CSPs, and explore how search can be combined with constraint propagation to find solutions.

The deepest results of Abel, Riemann,\n Weierstrass, and the most important works of Klein and Poincar/âe were part of this subject.\n In the middle of the 20th century algebraic geometry had been through a large reconstruction. The domain of\n application of its ideas had grown tremendously, in the direction of algebraic varieties over arbitrary fields\n and more general complex manifolds. Many of the best achievements of algebraic geometry could be cleared\n of the accusation of incomprehensibility or lack of rigour.\n The foundation for this reconstruction was (commutative) algebra. In the 1950s and 60s have brought\n substantial simplifications to the foundation of algebraic geometry, which significantly came closer to the\n ideal combination of logical transparency and geometric intuition.\n Commutative algebra is essentially the study of the rings occurring in algebraic number theory and algebraic\n geometry. In algebraic number theory, the rings of algebraic integers in number fields constitute an important\n class of commutative rings â the Dedekind domains. This has led to the notions of integral extensions and\n integrally closed domains. The notion of localization of a ring (in particular the localization with respect to a\n prime ideal leads to an important class of commutative rings â the local rings. The set of the prime ideals\n of a commutative ring is naturally equipped with a topology â the Zariski topology.

Special\n efforts are made to present the concepts at the center of the field in a coherent, tightly knit way, streamlined\n proofs and a focus on the core results.

The deepest results of Abel, Riemann, Weierstrass, and the most important works of Klein and Poincar/âe were part of this subject. In the middle of the 20th century algebraic geometry had been through a large reconstruction. The domain of application of its ideas had grown tremendously, in the direction of algebraic varieties over arbitrary fields and more general complex manifolds. Many of the best achievements of algebraic geometry could be cleared of the accusation of incomprehensibility or lack of rigour. The foundation for this reconstruction was (commutative) algebra. In the 1950s and 60s have brought substantial simplifications to the foundation of algebraic geometry, which significantly came closer to the ideal combination of logical transparency and geometric intuition. Commutative algebra is essentially the study of the rings occurring in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. In algebraic number theory, the rings of algebraic integers in number fields constitute an important class of commutative rings â the Dedekind domains. This has led to the notions of integral extensions and integrally closed domains. The notion of localization of a ring (in particular the localization with respect to a prime ideal leads to an important class of commutative rings â the local rings.
