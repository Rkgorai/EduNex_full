What's more, this space -- known as the two dimensional Projective Plane -- is surprisingly different from the familiar Euclidean plane.
 
 By examining some basic questions related to perspective drawing, like why parallel lines appear to converge in our vision, we can identify and analyze the defining properties of this space - properties which are well known to our visual sense, but defy our logical intuition.
 
 As the course progresses, we will situate perspective drawing in the framework of Projective Geometry, and get familiar with the algebra of homogeneous coordinates, which will allow us to translate our sensory intuition into precise information we can easily communicate. We will also get to know the topological space known as the real projective plane, as well the matrix group that governs its transformations.
 
 Being a four-week long elective, this course will nicely complement standard courses on geometry and topology, by giving hands-on experience with several important mathematical objects you will meet in those classes. Some basic linear algebra will be required, especially in the final week of the course (in particular, we will assume familiarity with vector calculus and with matrices as linear transformations).

Electromagnetic radiation covers a wide range of frequencies from gamma rays to radio frequencies. Depending on the frequency of radiation interacting with the matter, one can have different forms of spectroscopy. These spectroscopic techniques allow us to monitor the structural properties of matter. For example, information on moment of inertia (and hence bond length) can be obtained from rotational spectrum. Similarly, vibrational spectrum provides information on the force constant, i.e. the strength of a chemical bond.
 
 Besides providing information on molecular structure, spectroscopic techniques can also be used for quantitative estimation of a substance making spectroscopy an important analytical tool. Further, a spectroscopic transition is characterized by a definite timescale and this can provide information on molecular dynamics. 
 
 In this course, the fundamental principles of the different forms of spectroscopy will be elaborated in a unified way from both theoretical and experimental viewpoints. Application of these different spectroscopic methods for the elucidation of molecular structure will also be discussed.
